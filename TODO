- biocontainer instead of yaml file?
- think about caching the overlay prefix sums during construction...
    - would yeld another giant speedup!
- remove vector sorter in favour of adding sort method to the vectors
- make columns of overlays share same sparse coords lookup array?
    - or is this alleviated with the dependent dimension?





    === summary before vacation ===

- size estimation now works 
    - it now actually samples the required values instead of predicting them
    - caveat: dependant dim size estimation still broken because position of overlays is determined wrongly

- dependant dim makes file smaller from 1.75Gb to 1.2Gb
    - worth the effort? :/
    - thinking of dropping it

- shekalyan et. al's. size prediction seems to hit the optimum actually
    - at least for Hi-C data
    - for own distributions i can make examples where he is suboptimal

 - sparse coordinates vector should be cached instead of disk based
 - right now: fixing zero value of overlays
