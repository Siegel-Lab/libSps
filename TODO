- biocontainer instead of yaml file?
- think about caching the overlay prefix sums during construction...
    - would yeld another giant speedup!
- make columns of overlays share same sparse coords lookup array?
    - by checking if sparse coords are exactly the same -> should actually happen quite soon
    - requires size estimation adjustment
- think about the sparse coordinate arrays
    - right now they are double -> once for the overlay once for the internal prefix sums
    - the internal sparse coords could be computed form the overlay sparse coords
    - price: 1 more lookup; gain: less coords storage

    - sparse coords could also be a binary searchable list instead
        - no more O(1) complexity
        - much less storage

- store list of individual points for each poision of the prefix sum array
    - requires one additional vector
    - then points can be searched by iteration at smallest resolution
    - try other sparse coords arrays before trying this





     === summary before vacation ===

- dependant dim makes file smaller from 1.75Gb to 1.2Gb
    - worth the effort? :/
    - thinking of dropping it

- shekalyan et. al's. size prediction seems to hit the optimum actually
    - at least for Hi-C data
    - for own distributions i can make examples where he is suboptimal
