Bug:

- second coord system fails for anno coords
- divide by col & row giving wired results
- all computational nodes should also know what dependencies are from previous nodes (to make sure no dep is forgotten)


Features (ranked)

- check fastest way to export dict via pybind11

- think about caching the overlay prefix sums during construction...
    - would yield another giant speedup!
    - requires size estimation adjustment

- think about the sparse coordinate arrays
    - right now they are double -> once for the overlay once for the internal prefix sums
    - the internal sparse coords could be computed form the overlay sparse coords
    - price: 1 more lookup; gain: less coords storage

- store list of individual points for each poision of the prefix sum array
    - requires one additional vector
    - then points can be searched by iteration at smallest resolution
    - try other sparse coords arrays before trying this

- biocontainer instead of yaml file?

- conditions in the computational graph of libCm???
