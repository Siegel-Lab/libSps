- biocontainer instead of yaml file?
- think about caching the overlay prefix sums during construction...
    - would yeld another giant speedup!
- remove vector sorter in favour of adding sort method to the vectors
- make columns of overlays share same sparse coords lookup array?
    - or is this alleviated with the dependent dimension?
