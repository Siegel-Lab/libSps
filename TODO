Bug:

- second coord system fails for anno coords
- divide by col & row giving wired results


Features (ranked)

- grid queries

- grid-seq:
    - remove coverage indices for replicates
    - sample average coverage from contigs -> pick x many
    - coverage should be separate system form replicates

- hdf5 storage

- separate counts by annotation
    - each annotation becomes several +-1 intervals
    - filters to display only counts of specific type
    - anno coord system

- list based compilation parameter system

- think about caching the overlay prefix sums during construction...
    - would yield another giant speedup!
    - requires size estimation adjustment

- think about the sparse coordinate arrays
    - right now they are double -> once for the overlay once for the internal prefix sums
    - the internal sparse coords could be computed form the overlay sparse coords
    - price: 1 more lookup; gain: less coords storage

- store list of individual points for each poision of the prefix sum array
    - requires one additional vector
    - then points can be searched by iteration at smallest resolution
    - try other sparse coords arrays before trying this

- biocontainer instead of yaml file?

- conditions in the computational graph of libCm???
