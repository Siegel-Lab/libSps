Bug:

- divide by col & row giving wired results
- recheck effectiveness of other size optimization: old check was bugged and completely uninformative


Features (ranked)

- annotation filters new system

- grid-seq:
    - remove coverage indices for replicates
    - sample average coverage from contigs -> pick x many
    - coverage should be separate system form replicates

- grid queries
  - can also be use din construction
  - two types of implementation: 
    - static definition of grid
    - dynamic caching of queried positions

- store list of individual points for each poision of the prefix sum array
    - requires one additional vector
    - then points can be searched by iteration at smallest resolution
    - try other sparse coords arrays before trying this
    - store points in cooler format basically
      - pos x from, pos y from, pos x to, pos y to, mapq, filters, ...
      - sorted by columns

- list based compilation parameter system

- move code into smaller files
  - e.g. file for grid queries / single queries & fullQueries

- hdf5 storage

- think about caching the overlay prefix sums during construction...
    - would yield another giant speedup!
    - requires size estimation adjustment

- biocontainer instead of yaml file?

- conditions in the computational graph of libCm???
